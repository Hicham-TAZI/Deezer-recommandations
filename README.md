# Deezer-recommandations
In this mini-project we will set up a word2vec network and use it to build a playlist completion tool (song suggestion). The data is hosted on the following repository: http://github.com/comeetie/deezerplay.git. To know more about word2vec and the data we are going to use you can read the following two references:

* Efficient estimation of word representations in vector space, Tomas Mikolov, Kai Chen, Greg Corrado, and Jeffrey Dean. (https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781)
* Word2vec applied to Recommendation: Hyperparameters Matter, H. Caselles-Dupr√©, F. Lesaint and J. Royo-Letelier. (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04212.pdf)
